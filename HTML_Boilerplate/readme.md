# HTML BOILERPLATE
so HTML files or documents have the same basic structure or boilerplate that needs to be there before 
anything can be done.
<br> To write a basic structure for an HTML document
<br> To open HTML file in our browser

  ## Creating an HTML document index.html
  <br> a) Create a folder in your computer and name it as html-boilerplate
  <br> b) create a new file with name index.html, html files always ends with an extension of .html
  <br> c) every html file starts with a doctype declaration. What's a doctype declaration? It's purpose is tell the browser what version of HTML is being used for the document. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  <br> d) add `<html>` element. As discussed in elements, this is the root tag of the document and every other document will be under this. 
  <br> e) `<html lang="en">`, lang is an HTML attribute which is a part of HTML which tells the language of the text. 
  <br> f) `<head>` it is always under `<html>` and should always be the first element in it, what it is though? this is where we put important information about the website
  <br> g) setting an encoding is critical because it ensures that weboage displays important symbols and characters from different lanaguage correctly in a web browser
  <br> h) Title element, add `<title>` it provides a title to the website, otherwise the user won't know what's the website about! If title isn't mentioned, the webpage's title would be the default its file name.
```html
<title>my first weboage title</title>

```
<br> i) the element that is needed to complete an HTML structure is `<body` element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go whether it's text, images,lists and links etc.
