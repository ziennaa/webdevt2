# Elements and tags
elements are a piece of content wrapped in opemning and closing HTML tags. 
It tells the browser what's the start of HTML file. `<>` To create a paragraph in HTML, we use the `<p>` tag.
wheras closing tag determines the end of the element, difference arises in is that they have a backslash.
Example: `</>`, this is how we close it `</p>`
Example: 
```html
<p> This is a paragraph </p>
```
HTML has a variety of predefined or built in tags. It's important to use these tags effectively as they impact a lot on how our sites 
are ranked in search engines and how accesible it is to users. the practice of using the tags appropriately is called semantic HTML.
<br> some predeinfed tags are shown below </br>

```<html>``` called the root element, all other elements are under this  <br>
```<base>``` Defines the base URL for all relative links on the page. You can only have one `<base>` tag in a document.<br>
`<head>`  Contains important information about the webpage such as its title and stylesheets. <br>
`<link>`  Creates a connection between the current webpage and an external resource, like CSS stylesheets or any link <br>
`<title>` Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar <br>
`<body>` Represents the main content of the webpage that will be displayed to users. There can only be one `<body>` tag in an HTML document. <br>

### Void Elements
Some HTML elements do not have closing tag
`<br>` or `<img>`. These are called void elements since theyre void of any content
