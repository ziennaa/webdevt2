# the odin recepie project
After learning the fundamentals of HTML, I created a small recipe website. It has three popular recipes: pizza, burgers, and lasagna. It's quite basic. we can view each dish's dedicated page, where I've included the ingredients and simple instructions, click on it. Ideal for anyone wishing to sample something delicious!
